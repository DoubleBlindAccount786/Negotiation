% QUERY:I would like to know if
     there is evidence that product Product exists and
     Maker is  c and
     Price is  lowest and
     there is no evidence that the proposal for product Product from maker Maker at price Price is acceptable.

	ANSWER:	1 (in 2.044 ms)

JUSTIFICATION_TREE:
there is evidence that product a exists, and
there is no evidence that the proposal for product a from maker c at price lowest is acceptable, because
    there is evidence that product a exists, justified above, and
    there is evidence of product a being made by c, and
    there is evidence of a being of good quality, and
    there is no evidence that seller accepts selling product a from maker c at price lowest, because
        there is no evidence that the product a from maker c at price lowest is acceptable for Seller.
The global constraints hold.

MODEL:
{ evidence(product(a)),  evidence(maker(a,c)),  evidence(quality(a)) }
BINDINGS: 
Product equal a 
Maker equal c 
Price equal lowest


	ANSWER:	2 (in 1.994 ms)

JUSTIFICATION_TREE:
there is evidence that product b exists, and
there is no evidence that the proposal for product b from maker c at price lowest is acceptable, because
    there is evidence that product b exists, justified above, and
    there is no evidence that there is evidence of product b being made by c.
The global constraints hold.

MODEL:
{ evidence(product(b)) }
BINDINGS: 
Product equal b 
Maker equal c 
Price equal lowest
