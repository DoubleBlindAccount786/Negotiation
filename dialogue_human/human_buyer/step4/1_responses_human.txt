                    there is no evidence that there is evidence of buyer not being a student, justified above, and
                    it is assumed that buyer is a student.
            there is no evidence that buyer accepts buying product Var21 not equal a, nor b from maker Var22 at price low, because
                there is no evidence that there is evidence that product Var21 not equal a, nor b exists.
            the customer is a student, justified above, and
            there is no evidence that buyer accepts buying product a from maker Var24 not equal c at price low, because
                there is evidence that product a exists, justified above, and
                there is no evidence that there is evidence of product a being made by Var24 not equal c.
            there is no evidence that buyer accepts buying product a from maker c at price low, justified above, and
            there is no evidence that buyer accepts buying product b from maker Var27 not equal d at price low, because
                there is evidence that product b exists, justified above, and
                there is no evidence that there is evidence of product b being made by Var27 not equal d.
            there is no evidence that buyer accepts buying product b from maker d at price low, justified above, and
            there is no evidence that seller can bargain about the price of product Var30 not equal b, and
            seller can bargain about the price of product b, and
            buyer pays in cash, justified above, and
            there is no evidence that buyer accepts buying product b from maker Var33 not equal d at price low, because
                there is evidence that product b exists, justified above, and
                there is no evidence that there is evidence of product b being made by Var33 not equal d.
            seller can bargain about the price of product b, justified above.
The global constraints hold.
