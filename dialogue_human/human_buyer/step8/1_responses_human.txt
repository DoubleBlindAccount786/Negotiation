	ANSWER:	1 (in 30.667 ms)

JUSTIFICATION_TREE:
the proposal for product a from maker c at price low is acceptable, because
    seller accepts selling product a from maker c at price low, because
        the product a from maker c at price low is acceptable for Seller, because
            the customer is senior, because
                buyer is older than 65 years, because
                    there is evidence of buyer being older than 65 years.
            there is no evidence that buyer accepts buying product Var3 not equal a, nor b from maker Var4 at price high, because
                there is no evidence that there is evidence that product Var3 not equal a, nor b exists.
            there is no evidence that buyer accepts buying product a from maker Var6 not equal c at price high, because
                there is evidence that product a exists, and
                there is no evidence that there is evidence of product a being made by Var6 not equal c.
            there is no evidence that buyer accepts buying product a from maker c at price high, because
                there is evidence that product a exists, justified above, and
                there is evidence of product a being made by c.
            there is no evidence that buyer accepts buying product b from maker Var9 not equal d at price high, because
                there is evidence that product b exists, and
                there is no evidence that there is evidence of product b being made by Var9 not equal d.
            there is no evidence that buyer accepts buying product b from maker d at price high, because
                there is evidence that product b exists, justified above, and
                there is evidence of product b being made by d.
The global constraints hold.

{ query(a,c,low),  sale(a,c,low),  offer_price_a(a,c,low),  senior_customer,  age_older_than_65,  evidence(age_older_than_65),  evidence(product(a)),  evidence(maker(a,c)),  evidence(product(b)),  evidence(maker(b,d)) }
BINDINGS: 
Product equal a 
Maker equal c 
Price equal low
