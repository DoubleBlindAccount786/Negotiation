        buyer can buy the product b from maker d at price lowest, because
            the product b is made by d, because
                the product b exists, because
                    there is a product b, because
                        there is evidence that product b exists.
                there is evidence of product b being made by d.
            there is no evidence that the product Var3 not equal a, nor b is made by c, because
                there is no evidence that the product Var3 not equal a, nor b exists, and
                there is no evidence that the product Var3 not equal a, nor b exists.
            the product a is made by c, because
                the product a exists, because
                    there is a product a, because
                        there is evidence that product a exists.
                there is evidence of product a being made by c.
            the product a is made by c, justified above, and
            there is no evidence that seller accepts selling product a from maker c at price lowest, because
                the product a exists, justified above, and
                the product a is made by c, justified above.
            there is no evidence that the product b is made by c, because
                the product b exists, justified above, and

                it is assumed that there is no evidence that the product b is made by c.
        the product b is of good quality, because
            there is evidence of b being of good quality.
The global constraints hold.

MODEL:

BINDINGS: 
Product equal b 
Maker equal d 
Price equal lowest
