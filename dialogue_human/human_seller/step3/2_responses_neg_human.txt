% QUERY:I would like to know if
     Product is  a and
     Maker is  c and
     Price is  high and
     there is no evidence that the proposal for product Product from maker Maker at price Price is acceptable.

	ANSWER:	1 (in 1.891 ms)

JUSTIFICATION_TREE:
there is no evidence that the proposal for product a from maker c at price high is acceptable, because
    there is no evidence that buyer accepts buying product a from maker c at price high, because
        there is no evidence that buyer can buy the product a from maker c at price high, because
            the product a is made by c, because
                the product a exists, because
                    there is a product a, because
                        there is evidence that product a exists.
                there is evidence of product a being made by c.
            the product a is made by c, justified above.
The global constraints hold.

MODEL:
{ maker(a,c),  product(a),  product_a,  evidence(product(a)),  evidence(maker(a,c)) }
BINDINGS: 
Product equal a 
Maker equal c 
Price equal high
