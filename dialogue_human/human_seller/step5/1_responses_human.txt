            the product b is made by d, because
                the product b exists, justified above, and
                there is no evidence that there is evidence of product b being made by d, and
                the product b exists, justified above, and
                there is no evidence that there is evidence of product b not being made by d, and
                there is no evidence that there is evidence of product b not being made by d, justified above, and
                it is assumed that the product b is made by d.
            the product b is made by d, justified above, and
            there is no evidence that seller accepts selling product b from maker d at price lowest, because
                the product b exists, justified above, and
                the product b is made by d, justified above, and
                it is assumed that there is no evidence that seller accepts selling product b from maker d at price lowest.
        the product a is of good quality, because
            there is evidence of a being of good quality.
The global constraints hold.
