% QUERY:I would like to know if
     Product is  b and
     Maker is  d and
     Price is  low and
     there is no evidence that the proposal for product Product from maker Maker at price Price is acceptable.

	ANSWER:	1 (in 3.466 ms)

JUSTIFICATION_TREE:
there is no evidence that the proposal for product b from maker d at price low is acceptable, because
    there is evidence of buyer paying in cash, and
    there is no evidence that buyer accepts buying product b from maker d at price low, because
        there is no evidence that buyer can buy the product b from maker d at price low, because
            the product b is made by d, because
                the product b exists, because
                    there is a product b, because
                        there is evidence that product b exists.
                there is evidence of product b being made by d.
The global constraints hold.

MODEL:
{ evidence(cash),  maker(b,d),  product(b),  product_b,  evidence(product(b)),  evidence(maker(b,d)) }
BINDINGS: 
Product equal b 
Maker equal d 
Price equal low
